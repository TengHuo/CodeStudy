## [Udacity: Intro to Machine Learning](/ud120-projects)

Course Home Page: [Intro to Machine Learning](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud120)

This is the best beginning course for ml. It teaches three different machine learning algorithms, naive bayes, SVM, decision tree and linear regression. The course doesn't introduce a lot of mathematics, but they explain the theory of the algorithms very well.
